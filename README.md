This project 'siblings' contains the data and code for the analyses presented in 'Human Monogamy in Mammalian Context'.

The two main datasets are those containing data on the observed number of full siblings, paternal half sibs, and maternal half sibs across 103 human populations ('Human data.csv') and 34 mammal species ('nonhuman data.csv').

The code required to reproduce the main results/figures of the paper are 'Figure 1' and 'Figure 2'. The latter contains the model to predict sibling proportions. The file ESM contains the code for Figures S1-4

In addition to the above, there are four pieces of 'counter' code that can calculate sibling dyads and reproductive exclusivity based on raw parentage data, as housed in the folders 'aDNA', 'kinsources', and 'mammals'.
