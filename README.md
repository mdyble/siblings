This project 'siblings' contains the data and code for the analyses presented in 'Human Monogamy in Comparative Context'.

The two main datasets are those containing data on the observed number of full siblings, paternal half sibs, and maternal half sibs across 106 human populations ('Human data.csv') and 35 mammal species ('nonhuman data.csv').

The code required to reproduce the main results/figures of the paper are 'Figure 1' and 'Figure 2'. The latter contains the model to predict sibling proportions. The additional code ('EPP model robustness  figure') is for parameter exploration for that model. 

In addition to the above, there are three pieces of 'counter' code that can calculate the number and composition of sibling dyads based on raw parentage data, as housed in the folders 'aDNA', 'kinsources', and 'mammals'.

Data from any additional species or human populations gratefully received! Contact: Mark Dyble, md479@cam.ac.uk
